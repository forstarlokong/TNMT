# TNMT
TUK Network Management Tool for Efficient Network Monitoring and Troubleshooting.

#ABSTRACT:

This abstract presents a proposal for a Network Management Tool designed to assist network administrators at the Technical University of Kenya ICT Department in efficiently managing and monitoring all the Network Switches in the Technical University of Kenya network. The tool is equipped with features such as real-time network monitoring, performance monitoring, device management alert, automated tasks, and reporting. 
The primary objective of the tool is to simplify network management tasks, automate repetitive tasks, and improve network uptime and availability at The Technical University of Kenya. The proposed Tool is also suitable for medium to large networks and managed service providers. With this tool, TUK network administrators can easily identify, diagnose, and troubleshoot network issues promptly, leading to enhanced network management efficiency and minimal network downtime.

#Objectives

#Project Goal (Major Objectives) Overall Goal:

To provide real-time network monitoring that enables network administrators at TUK ICT Department to detect and diagnose network issues promptly by ensuring that the switches are always active.

#Specific Objectives
1.	To provide switches performance monitoring that tracks network performance, including latency, and packet loss.
2.	To provide device management and alerts that enables network administrators to manage network devices from a central location.
3.	To automate repetitive network management tasks, that is, sending ICMP ping packets at intervals to check for activities of the switches. 
4.	To provide detailed reports on network performance, device status, and store the information in a reference directory.
